# Frontend-Signaturit

## About

This is the `Full stack` coding challenge of Signaturit.
This project is structured as a `Clean Architecture`, with the principles of `Clean Code` and `SOLID`.

## Commands

Please note that you also need [backend-signaturit](https://github.com/rmyz/backend-signaturit) running in the background in the `PORT=3025` to make the petitions of the game work.

First of all, we need to install the project:

```
  npm i
```

After that, we can both launch the dev server or the test runner.

To launch the dev server:

```
  npm run start
```

To run the tests:

```
  npm run test
```
